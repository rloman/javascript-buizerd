Create a Beer app

Requirements

Have a class Repository which is 
	able to save an instance of class Beer 
	in an Array

we can get the elements of the 
	array using an 
	ASYNCHRONOUS findAll() method

Actions:
add some beers to the repository (3 or some)
print them

keywords: you have to use
class
array
async await
some kind of loop
require (to read in a module)

Bonus:
make a findBeerByName(name) method which returns a Beer with the given name
if that beer does not exist an Error is thrown

Oplevering: via een repo op github!!!
